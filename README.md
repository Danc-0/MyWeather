# MyWeather

Ignoring the weather in the stories we tell just isn’t an option, and also identifying the weather pattern isn’t easy. But with MyWeather am building an app that provide weather information about cities in different countries.
Its to give users an ability to make decision on what to do and what to expect. Am using [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to receive the updates.
